Description: This package contains a function definition under the script HW_2_mghazanf.R.
    The function, crime_correlate, takes three arguments: a dataframe of crime data, a description of 
    offence commited and the names of two suburbs. The data of the latter 2 arguments should match the crime
    data. After that the crime data is filtered to create a table of dates and total offences for said 
    date in the suburb and offence category. This data is returned as a line plot that shows the specific 
    number of offences on that day along with a general smoothing line that indicates the trend of increasing 
    or decreasing number of offences overtime.
